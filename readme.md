      -=
      *=
      /=
      %=
      **=

Comparison Operators
      ==    equal to
      ===   equal value and equal type
      !=    not equal
      !==   note qual value or not equal type
      >     greater than
      <     less than
      <=    greater than or equal to
      >=    less than or equal to
      ?     ternary operator

Logical Operators
       &&   logical and
       ||   logical or
       !    logical not

Bitwise Operators
       &       AND
       |       OR
       ~       NOT
       ^       XOR
       <<      left shift
       >>      right shift
       >>>     unsigned right shift


For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.

Arithmetic Operators
a = 10;
b = 5;

sum = a + b;
sum = 10 + 5;
sum = 15;

exponentialResult = a ** b;
exponentialResult = 10 ** 5;
exponentialResult = 100000;

Assignment Operators
let z = z * 6 same as let z *= 6;
let q = q / 6 same as let z /= 6;

Comparison Operators
a = 10;
b = 5;

a > b = 10 > 5;
a != b = 10 != 5;

Logical Operators
a = 10;
b = 5;

(a > 9 && b < 6) is true	
(a == 5 || y == 1) is false

Bitwise Operators
a = 12;
b = 25;

a & b = 12 & 25 = 8
a | b = 12 | 25 = 29


Execution of
for (let i=1; i < 20; i +=7){
    console.log(i);
}
Result to:
1, 8, 15
